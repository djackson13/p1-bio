<h4>Major</h4>

<p>I am majoring in visual communication design at Eastern Washington University. I will have all of my graduate requirements for my Bachelors of Arts Degree as well as a studio art minor fulfilled by the end of winter quarter 2014. </p>

<h4>Background Information</h4>

<p>I am a graphic designer, artist, father and generally curious human being.  I currently reside in Spokane Washington, living in the beautiful Perry district and am finishing my last year at EWU. Supporting my family by cooking on the weekends at the Lantern Tap House. This fulfills his my need to create and love of food as well. My major in visual communication design and minor in studio art, presented itself as the perfect commingling of the logical and intuitive, artistic nature, giving myself the opportunity to create objects with a lasting impact on culture, society, and commercial industries. My self-motivated style of learning has allowed me to jump into my educational endeavors full force and has earned me an accumulated grade point average is 3.41. I describe my design skills as concise and informed. Being an introvert, I prefer to work alone on most projects, but also see the value of groups, in the form of different perspectives. I find the most important, and influential leaders of the past are those who are service leaders and lead by example. This is because I am more like a curious observer who carefully soaks in the world around him. I consider my nature more like that of water, which gives and bends around anything that is thrown it’s way, but does not break and maintains it’s integrity. Unlike a hard surface that asserts itself into this world. Leading by this example, I  am careful to consider my audience when sharing my points of view in a creative setting and do enjoy sharing them.  </p>

<h4>Professional Objectives</h4>

<p>I am a well rounded creative professional seeking a position at a creative firm or in house design for a business, specializing in media (video and images). I prefer to be involved in the whole design process from stategizing and conceptualization to presenting to clients, in order to produce a cohesive functional design.</p>
